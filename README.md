lresource is a simple solution for embedding static resources inside of Go binaries.

# Install

```
go get github.com/belfinor/lresource
```

# Embed resource

You have directory *data*, that contains *text.txt* file (may be binary) of the following contents:

```
English texts for beginners to practice reading and comprehension online and for free.

```

Create *generator.go* into *data*:

```go
// +build ignore

package main

import (

	"github.com/belfinor/lresource"
)

func main() {

	err := lresource.Convert("text.txt", "text.txt.go", "data", "data/text.txt", false)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

Create *data.go* with generate instruction:

```go
package data

//go:generate go run generator.go
```

Go to data and run generate:

```
cd data
go generate
```

And you have file *text.txt.go* like this:

```go
package data

// @comment this file was generated by lresource

import (
  "github.com/belfinor/lresource"
)

func init() {

  lresource.Add("data/text.txt", "text/plain; charset=utf-8", true, `

}
```

# Access resource from code

```go
import (

	"github.com/belfinor/lresource"
	_ "github.com/login/proj/data" // load data

)

func Get() []byte {

  data := lresource.Get("data/text.txt")

	if data != nil {
		return data.Data
	}

  return nil
}
```

# Delete resource by name

```go
lresource.Delete("data/text.txt")
```

# If resource changed

If the *data.txt* file has changed, you go to the data directory and call *go generate*.
